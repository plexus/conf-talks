subsequent technologies gradually hand more work over to the system, away from the programmer
this prevents the programmer from making certain mistakes
this allows the system to do more, better
eventually giving the programmer higher productivity

but first we need to relent some control
this is a hard sell, because people have a very hard aversion to giving things up
so they only see the downsides (at first)
it takes a while to see the benefits

formal languages are very well studied
formalization helps with meta-cognition, meta-programming
computers can't "reason", but they are very good at dealing with formalisms
so find a formalism that captures sufficiently well your knowledge/reasoning
and now you can pass the job on to the computer

a system is defined by its boundaries

complex boundaries => complex system
ad-hoc boundaries  => ad-hox system

when the outside is let in, assimilation is necessary

"People want to stay in control of their lives and protect their boundaries. Every unit, whether a person, a cell or a government, has a cohesive force that preserves its identity and structure. This tendency contains within it resistance to change. Although boundaries often have negative connotations they are essential to the life process. A system is defined by its boundaries,which protect its internal integrity yet not in an absolute way, since all boundaries fluctuate as the organism interacts with the external world. When the outside is let in, whether emotionally or physically (eating, for example), assimilation is always necessary for the process to continue. Boundaries can easily become overly rigid, however, isolating a person from the flow of life (or the system from its environment) to a degree that can become destructive to the individual himself. "
