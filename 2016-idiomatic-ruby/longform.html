We need to talk about idioms, about what you call<br>
“idiomatic Ruby”. What does it mean? Where does it come from? Why would be want<br>
it?</p>
<p>Let’s first look at the word, “idiomatic”. Idiomatic means “relating to, or<br>
confirming to idiom”, so what is idiom?</p>
<p>Idiom has two separate, but related, meanings. An idiom is a way of using<br>
language that is particular to a specific group. It can also mean a specific,<br>
peculiar phrase or expression that is commonly understood, even though its<br>
meaning isn’t self-obvious.</p>
<p>Example idioms are “to kick the bucket”, or “Bob’s your uncle”, but the latter<br>
is only common in the British idiom, not the American.</p>
<p>In programming we, too, have idioms. They are like tiny design patterns, ways of<br>
doing things “in the small” that have been proven to work well, and are part of<br>
idiom programmers share.</p>
<p>This is the Ruby idiom for having a file with library code that can also be<br>
executed directly:</p>
<pre class='language-ruby'><code>if __FILE__ = $0

end
</code></pre>
<p>This is the Ruby idiom for a function that memoizes:</p>
<pre class='language-ruby'><code>def sum
  @sum ||= @left + @right
end
</code></pre>
<p>This is the Ruby idiom for doing precondition checks:</p>
<pre class='language-ruby'><code>def filter_negatives(list)
  raise &quot;list can&#x27;t be empty&quot; if list.empty?
  # ...
end
</code></pre>
<p>But being idiomatic isn’t just about using idioms, it is also about expressing<br>
yourself in a way that seems “natural”. To put it the other way, when something<br>
“sounds weird” to a native speaker, it’s a telltale sign you’re not being<br>
idiomatic. Should you tell someone: “please follow me along” that will be<br>
readily understood, but it doesn’t really sound <em>right</em>, whereas “come with me,<br>
please” would be a more idiomatic way of saying it.</p>
<p>Similarly, when programming, you often have more than one way to do something,<br>
and while all the options might be equivalent to the computer, some will “look<br>
weird” to other programmers, again a sign you are no longer being idiomatic.</p>
<p>But who defines what is and isn’t idiomatic? At first glance it would appear<br>
that no-one does, after all it’s just “how people speak” (or program, as the<br>
case may be), all we can do is describe it.</p>
<p>In reality though a small group of influencers will have a disproportianate<br>
amount of influence on how the idiom, the norm, evolves. These are the<br>
Shakespeares, the Charles Dickens, the T.S. Elliots of programming, the people<br>
writing famous libraries and frameworks, the programming elite, the rockstars we<br>
look up to. When you “lie low” or wish someone “good riddance”, you are quoting<br>
Shakespeare word for word. If you use “fail” and “raise” to make a semantic<br>
distinction, you can thank Jim Weirich for that.</p>
<p>There’s a second phenomon that has a big influence on idiom, and that is when<br>
description becomes prescription. This is the purpose of a style guide, to<br>
describe the rules that people already use, often unconsciously, and turn them<br>
into guidelines.</p>
<p>There are a few good reasons to do this. Some things are just objectively better<br>
than others, because they are more efficient, or because following the rules<br>
prevents common mistakes. For example, some programmers prefer “yoda conditions”<br>
for equality checks, because it prevents accidentally writing an assignment<br>
instead.</p>
<pre class='language-ruby'><code>if x = 3
  # does x equal 3? ah.. oops
end

if 3 == x
  # would raise an error if we accidentally used an assignment
end
</code></pre>
<p>Another reason for having a style guide is for consistency. Some things are<br>
simply arbitrary: use of whitecase, camelcase vs snake case, <code>proc {}</code> vs<br>
<code>Proc.new {}</code>, <code>foo</code> vs <code>foo()</code>. When code within the same file or project uses<br>
these things inconsitently, there are constantly things that look a bit out of<br>
place, thus wasting brain cycles that could have gone to understanding the<br>
program. Consistency eases refactoring, encourages shared ownership, and eases<br>
pair-programming.</p>
<p>But there’s a danger with style guides: they can cause a language to become<br>
stuck in its past. To see how far in the past, we need to only look at Chinese,<br>
up until the early 20th century the norm for written texts was still Classical<br>
Chinese, a language that had last been spoken two-thousand years prior.</p>
<p>Ruby is, as far as programming languages go, a very organic language. It was<br>
inspired by Perl, a language created by a linguist. Ruby is characterized by a<br>
flexible syntax, and by humane interfaces, where redundant aliases are provided<br>
merely to provide joy and expressive power to the programmer.</p>
<p>When you look around for older Ruby code, you can see how its style has evolved.<br>
I think we can roughly split the evolution of Ruby’s style and idiom into three<br>
eras: 1995-2005: the pre-Rails era, 2005-2010: the _why era, and 2010-now,<br>
post-why.</p>
<p>In the first era Ruby is still very much a niche language. Early adopters are<br>
mostly coming from Perl or C, and just like there are many styles of Perl (Perl<br>
embraces diversity), so we had several styles of Ruby. Everyone was new to the<br>
language, and so people used what was most familiar to them, Perl-ism, C-ism,<br>
etc.</p>
<p>By the early two-thousands Ruby has matured enough that it is starting to<br>
develop a style of its own. People are coming up with best practices and<br>
“Ruby-isms” that are considered good form. But there is still a lot of diversity<br>
in use of whitespace, placement of parentheses, choice of API aliases.</p>
<p>Then Rails hits the scene, and Ruby’s following explodes. The majority of<br>
Rubyists are beginners again. But this time there’s a clear blueprint to study<br>
and copy: Rails itself. From naming everything <code>acts_as_foo</code>, to widespread<br>
monkey-patching, to elaborate DSLs, the Rails way is the right way, because it’s<br>
all people know. Just mix it into ApplicationController! Cargo-culting abounds.</p>
<p>There is still significant variety in how things are done. _why is still around<br>
to encourage people to explore and be creative, and in many little ways people<br>
and teams develop their own styles.</p>
<p>Then we head towards 2010. The early adopters of Rails, and their startups, have<br>
now matured. With a couple years of experience maintaining a Ruby code base<br>
under their belt, people become a bit more cautious. Maybe this free-form<br>
creative programming comes at a price. Maybe these monkey patches and custom<br>
DSLs weren’t such a good idea to start with. Then _why disappears, discouraged<br>
and driven away at last, as we would later learn, by the pain of maintaining his<br>
own coding exploits. The wild days are over.</p>
<p>In 2011 Bozhidar Batsov starts writing the Ruby Style Guide. In 2012 work starts<br>
on Rubocop. Awareness of “good style” and “being idiomatic” increases”.<br>
Gradually people fall in line, and present day Ruby code, especially in<br>
open-source projects, is surprisingly consistent.</p>
<p>Since then a lot has been happening in programming language development. New<br>
languages like Rust, Elixir, Elm, Go, Idris are introducing new paradigms.<br>
Functional programming has gone mainstream, and Rubyists are starting to pay<br>
attention. We’re seeing a new wave of experimentation. Some of the resulting<br>
code may look foreign at first, but we would be wise not to dismiss it too<br>
quickly because it’s “not idiomatic”.</p>
<p>They want the same guarantees, reliability, expressiveness, concurrency<br>
constructs, that they’ve seen elsewhere. Distributed systems, multicore<br>
processing, fast and cheap random access memory, all of these change the context<br>
in which we as programmers operate, and so our code must change as well.</p>
<p>Here’s an example from the Transproc library, used heavily by ROM</p>
<pre class='language-ruby'><code>transformation = t(:map_array, t(:symbolize_keys)
 .&gt;&gt; t(:rename_keys, user_name: :user))
 .&gt;&gt; t(:wrap, :address, [:city, :street, :zipcode])
</code></pre>
<p>And here’s an example from the “transducers” gem</p>
<pre class='language-ruby'><code>require &#x27;transducers&#x27;
T = Transducers
T.transduce(T.compose(T.map(:succ), T.filter(:even?)), :&lt;&lt;, [], 0..9)
# =&gt; [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
</code></pre>
<p>And then there’s Kleisli. Here’s just one example from the documentation</p>
<pre class='language-ruby'><code>require &quot;kleisli&quot;

json_string = get_json_from_somewhere

result = Try { JSON.parse(json_string) } &gt;-&gt; json {
  Try { json[&quot;dividend&quot;].to_i / json[&quot;divisor&quot;].to_i }}
</code></pre>
<p>All of these look “weird” at first, because they implement features on top of<br>
Ruby that didn’t exist before. Transproc does functional compositions,<br>
Transducers implements, well, transducers, and Kleisli implements a number of<br>
useful monads.</p></section><script src='file:///home/arne/github/slippery/assets/shower/shower.min.js' type='text/javascript'></script></body></html>
