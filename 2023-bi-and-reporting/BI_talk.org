#+TITLE: BI and Data Warehousing for Datomic

* Context

Eleven is building a accounting system using Clojure and Datomic.

Gaiwan is a Clojure consultancy.

Eleven wanted to use Metabase to provide users with specific dashboards, e.g.
Profit-and-loss, Accounts Payable/Accounts Receivable.

Metabase has many database connector, but not for datomic.

* Datomic

* Getting at the data, first attempt: Metabase-datomic

- http://github.com/plexus/metabase-datomic
- Metabase "driver" for datomic
- Convert internal query format (sql-ish) to Datalog
- Nice that we have full control, we could provide extras like "virtual" table
- Worked reasonably well, but Metabase turns out to be an unreliable partner
  - Query format is considered "internal"
  - Can change at any time
  - And it did in the next version

#+begin_src clojure

 :filter [:=
          [:field-id 1291]
          [:value
           17592186046126
           {:base_type :type/FK,
            :special_type :type/FK,
            :database_type "db.type/ref"}]],
 :source-table 184,
 :limit 1048576,
 :join-tables

   :table-id 191,
   :fk-field-id 1291,
   :pk-field-id 1275}]}
#+end_src

* Creating the dashboards: embedkit

- For every company we need a set of dashboards
- Dashboards consist of cards
- Mutliple operations to create cards, dashboards
- Embedkit provides declarative EDN syntax, which is idempotent
- "Metabase as dashboard engine"

* Self-service metabase

- Users want to be able to create ad-hoc queries, custom dashboards
- We can use the API to give everyone a login
- But denormalized view needed to make data legible

* Getting at the data, Second attempt: Datomic Analytics

What is it?
- Driver for Presto (standalone SQL engine)
- Comes bundled with Datomic (Presto + driver)
- Powerful tool, we can create views in Presto

Problems
- Slow (many joins)
- Outdated Presto (Trino?)
- high operational overhead
- Only datomic driver is bundled, so can't use full power of Presto

* Getting at the data, Third attempt: Plenish

- Iterate over the tx-log
- Convert to JDBC (postgres) schema + data
- Transaction = transaction -> strong guarantee
- Similar metaschema as Datomic Analytics

"OMG queries are so fast now"


* notes from Q&A
- what about cloud and presto?
- indexes?
- plenish -> schema changes e.g. renames?
- only stores latest version, no history in postgres (beyond tx table)


* DEMO

docker run -e POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD=trust -p 5432:5432 postgres
docker run -p 3000:3000 metabase/metabase

33/34. slide about or-join, filter vs select
34/35. show metabase-datomic config?
36. replace Rich slide with public announcement
-- somewhere before plenish: OLAP vs OLTP
47. take out stripped down presto thing
50. move embedkit up to before metabase-datomic
56. Plenish. Now open source!
