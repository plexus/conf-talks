- Durkheim's idea of "collective effervescence," the heightened energy and sense of connection that emerges during social gatherings.
- social gatherings can be transformative because they bring together people who are socially relevant to each other.
 These gatherings often involve shared goals or activities, making the stakes feel higher. People are more concerned with presenting themselves well, which can lead to unexpected outcomes.
- social gatherings are more likely to be turning points than other daily activities.
 Unlike routine tasks, social gatherings can be unpredictable and consequential. They can be "fateful" situations where chance encounters or experiences can significantly alter someone's life trajectory.
- Social occasions can be sites of offense and violation. This can happen when people feel they can take liberties with their behavior due to the relaxed atmosphere of the occasion.
- a special world that is separate from ordinary life

1. A special world set off from ordinary life: Social occasions that feel distinct and extraordinary, such as those marking a status change or demanding significant resources, are more likely to be impactful.
2. Collective effervescence and emotional energy: The heightened energy and sense of connection created during social gatherings can make them more memorable and transformative.
3. Bringing usually disparate people together: When people from different social circles or backgrounds come together, it can lead to unexpected encounters and opportunities for change.
