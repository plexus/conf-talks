> Thinking outside the brain means skillfully **engaging entities external to our heads** ​— ​the feelings and movements of **our bodies**, the **physical spaces** in which we learn and work, and the minds of the **other people around us** ​— ​drawing them into our own mental processes. By reaching beyond the brain to recruit these **“extra-neural” resources**, we are able to **focus more intently**, **comprehend more deeply**, and **create more imaginatively** ​— ​to entertain ideas that would be literally unthinkable by the brain alone.

## Not thinking **about** but thinking **with** body, space, relationships.

- Some excellent beers in the 3~5% range
- Pilsner/Lager is 5.2%, stronger than in some places
- These days: excellent 0% beer!
