> Thinking outside the brain means skillfully **engaging entities external to our heads** ​— ​the feelings and movements of **our bodies**, the **physical spaces** in which we learn and work, and the minds of the **other people around us** ​— ​drawing them into our own mental processes. By reaching beyond the brain to recruit these **“extra-neural” resources**, we are able to **focus more intently**, **comprehend more deeply**, and **create more imaginatively** ​— ​to entertain ideas that would be literally unthinkable by the brain alone.

---

> It’s true that we’re more accustomed to thinking **about** our bodies, our spaces, and our relationships. But we can also **think with and through them** ​— ​by using the movements of our hands to understand and express abstract concepts, or by arranging our workspace in ways that promote idea generation, or by engaging in social practices like teaching and storytelling that lead to deeper understanding and more accurate memory. Rather than exhorting ourselves and others to use our heads, we should be **applying extra-neural resources to the project of thinking outside the skull’s narrow circumference**.
