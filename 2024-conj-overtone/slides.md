## My Overtone story

- Started learning Clojure Spring of 2013
- Overtone is what really got me hooked
- Revisited it every so often to do some creative coding

<!-- - Snuck Overtone+Clojure into the Rubymonstas -->

----

## Fast Forward to 2023

- Try to run my old Overtone code, and can't get it to boot
- Version on Clojars is from 2019, and is broken
- Bit more luck with latest git version, but still many issues

----

## Sad Face ðŸ˜¢

## Overtone could be **Timeless Software**

---

# 3. **Timeless** Software

---

## **SuperCollider** was first released in 1996. <br> It still has an active community.

Pulu performing with SuperCollider at Heart of Clojure 2024

## Making Overtone **Timeless**

- It has to just work
- Make sure the core is solid and stable
- Fix or improve the half baked stuff
- Add the missing pieces
- Grow an ecosystem (leipzig, disclojure, erv, piratidal, quil, plasticine, squid.casa/jack, squid.casa/midi, ...)

----

# 4. The Next **Ten Years** of Overtone

----

## Making sure we are ready for the future

- Many small fixes

----

## 0.13.3177 (2024-01-05)

# **DEMO**

<!-- --- -->

<!-- ## Dropped embedded SuperCollider -->

<!-- - Nobody wants to maintain JNI stuff and C build pipelines -->
<!-- - No more JVM Segfaults (!!) -->
<!-- - Easier to stay up to date -->
<!-- - Available on every OS and package manager -->

<!-- --- -->

<!-- ## Linux Audio -->

<!-- _**cue audience laughter**_ -->

<!-- --- -->

<!-- ## Linux Audio -->

<!-- - Is actually good now (Go PipeWire!) -->
<!-- - Try very hard to detect the user's setup and "just work" -->

<!-- # 5. **Maintaining** Overtone -->

<!-- ---- -->

<!-- ## Maintaining Overtone -->

<!-- - Sam and Jeff had a big vision -->
<!-- - It was not fully realized -->
<!-- - Lots of loose ends in the codebase -->
<!-- - I can't go back and read their minds -->

<!-- ---- -->

<!-- <\!-- ## What were they thinking? -\-> -->

<!-- <\!-- - Is this intentional or accidental? -\-> -->
<!-- <\!-- - Is it broken or do I not understand how it's supposed to work? -\-> -->
<!-- <\!-- - Does this serve a purpose or is part of something that never got finished? -\-> -->
<!-- <\!-- - How was this supposed to be used? -\-> -->

<!-- ---- -->

<!-- ## We need to be able to **revisit** some of that code that has been **frozen in time** -->

<!-- ---- -->

<!-- - I'm merging all PRs with minimal scrutiny -->
<!-- - We can always revert if it causes issues -->
