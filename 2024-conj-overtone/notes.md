I think that showing how easy it is to set up and start making music is always good.

Showing a panorama of the possibilities can also be helpful.

And also talking about the ecosystem. 

For example, the fact that Quil and Overtone can share memory is really fantastic. 

A mention of related libraries like
- leipzig
- disclojure
- erv 
- piratidal

as well as  yours and others I may be unaware of could be enticing.If you decide to go the demo route an excerpt from this might be good, as it uses quil and overtone (controlling the surge synthesizer): https://youtu.be/Y_z4gSD8UP0Additionally hereâ€™s a demo of a TidalCycles port to Clojure that leverages parts of Overtone: https://youtu.be/7qNSjhMf_HU
