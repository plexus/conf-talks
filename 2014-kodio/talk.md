# The Future

Distributed applications will evolve down two major paths. The first is based on hypermedia protocols. This will be used for applications that deal with concrete human information and content. The second path revolves around low-level binary communication, with higher speeds, lower overhead and lower power consumption. So for embedded devices, ubiquitous computing, the IoT, non-web/hypermedia formats will often be preferable. Bridges between these two worlds will be needed.

There is no doubt the face of technology will continue to change drastically, and with it how we live our lives will change as well. At the moment most of our interaction with digital applications still happens by facing a screen, be it the screen of our laptop, mobile or tablet. Increasingly though the technology will sink into our environment, something we can already see in home automation and in our cars. But these are just the obvious first steps. Wearable chips already exist, and devices that measure and shape ourselves and our environments will become ever more present and intelligent.

In short we can say that the amount of data we gather about ourselves, our society and our world will multiply many times. This will change our lives and our politics by enabling us to gain deeper insight and understanding. But it will also lead to a strong tension between transparency and privacy. Are we willing to share data about our lives to make the world a better place, but that can also be abused by governments and big businesses? Will governments be willing to disclose, and be held accountable for, the details of their operation?

We have already lost control over our devices. We can participate in this new world, but only if we accept that our devices run software, collect data and communicate with government and businesses without us having a say in the matter, or clear insight in what is being collected and shared. As has been the case up to now, the majority will gladly accept this poisoned apple. But a niche movement building open hardware, and vendor-independent applications built on encryption will continue to operate on the sideline, providing a much needed alternative, and questioning the status quo.
