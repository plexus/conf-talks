Outline

* Pre-history : Advent of the World Wide Web
** events
*** 1990 The first web server and browser are written
*** 1990-09 Berners-Lee and Cailliau pitch their ideas to the European Conference on Hypertext Technology
*** 1993 Mosaic
*** 1994 first international WWW conference
*** 1995- commercial browsers, big growth, until 2001 dot-com burst
* Fielding : understanding the power of the web archictecture
** Client-server
** Stateless
** Layered system
** Uniform Interface
*** Resource identifiers
*** Resources
*** Resource representations
***

* WWW is invented
* WWW becomes unexpectedly popular
* Fielding : why? what makes REST so special?
* Web Services, use HTTP for machine-2-machine
* Semantic web : a vision of a smarter web

* lots of buzz around "web services" (i.e. SOAP)
* AJAX, Web 2.0
* The two main application platforms, browser + phone, grow up
* PaaS

* Metrics in our pockets : a smarter environment
* Semantic web revisted : Open Data
* REST revisited : Hypermedia formats

* Quantified self
* Internet of Things
* NSA & Snowden : what have we lost?

* the future ;
* massive collecting of information
* massive interconnectedness
* meta-services, aggregation, discovery, directory
* diversity in devices and interactions
* further undermining/strengthening of privacy
* change in politics and society : transparency and insights

Major themes

* CORBA > SOAP > REST > Hypermedia, i.e. what's up with this fielding dude anyway
* The face of "computing" is changing. Desktops > Laptops > Phones > Wearable > Ubiquitous
* We are gathering ever more data, and more data is ever more machine-consumable
* We have already lost our privacy, it's not getting better
* In the best case this will make our society and politics smarter, transparent, accountable
* In the optimistic case this will give bigcorp more control over our lives and our society
* I don't want to think about the non-optimistic case
